# computer-setup
Set up script for my personal computer

I like the concept of having portable dot file so ZSH, VSCode, LazyVim, Warp, Obsidian, Brave and other command line tool would be install with package manager (brew for Mac, nix for Linux) and makefile.

I like the approach and idea nix but It is too cumbersome. I would love to use it for my devenv tho [template](https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates) and [article](https://determinate.systems/posts/nix-direnv/). I will gradually move everything to Nix + home manager
